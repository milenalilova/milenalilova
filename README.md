# Hi there! 👋  

🌱 I recently completed training in **back-end web development** with **Python** and **Django**. Currently, I’m expanding my skills in **front-end development**, learning **CSS**, **HTML**, and **JavaScript**.  

### ✨ What drives me  
- I’m passionate about the **process of learning** and acquiring new skills.  
- Tackling challenges, building web applications, and growing my technical abilities has been an incredibly rewarding journey.  

### 💻 My journey so far  
- Hands-on experience with **Django** for back-end development.  
- Exploring **front-end technologies** to create interactive and user-friendly web experiences.  

### 🌍 Beyond coding  
When I’m not at my desk, you’ll find me:  
- **Climbing volcanoes**  
- **Walking in the Amazonian jungle**  
- **Hiking** or **birdwatching**  

🚀 I’m excited to keep learning and growing, one project at a time.
