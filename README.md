Hi there! ðŸ‘‹

I recently completed training in back-end web development with Python and Django, and Iâ€™m now diving into front-end development with CSS, HTML, and JavaScript.

ðŸŒ± What excites me most is the process of learning and acquiring new skills. The challenge of building web applications and expanding my technical abilities has been a rewarding experience.

ðŸ’» My journey so far:

  *  Gaining hands-on experience with Django for back-end development.
  *  Exploring the world of front-end development to create more interactive and user-friendly web experiences.

âœ¨ Fun fact: When Iâ€™m not coding, youâ€™ll find me climbing volcanoes, walking in the Amazonian jungle, or enjoying hiking and birdwatchingâ€”adventures that keep me curious and inspired!

Iâ€™m excited to continue learning and growing, one project at a time. ðŸš€
